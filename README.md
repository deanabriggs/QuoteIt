# Overview
This software was designed to test the usability and functionality of a NoSQL cloud database with Python to solve a real world problem. It includes working with Cloud Firestore collections, documents, subcollections, and a map within a subcollection. It includes Python functions, import features, and a menu design.

This project addresses the issue of sales reps needing to give quick estimates to customers during an on-site walk through. It allows them to build a quote by responding to prompts. The program will calculate a quote based on the entries and store it for later reference. The sales rep can create multiple quotes for the same customer.

The user (sales rep) is presented with a menu of options and prompts in Python. Python functions calculate and format entered data for customers, equipments, and quotes. Then, Python transmits the data to the Cloud Firestore database so it can be search or retrieved.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}
